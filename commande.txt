2.2.1. Embedding A Flow On A Page

By default Web Flow does a client-side redirect upon entering every view state. That makes it impossible to embed a flow on a page or within a modal dialog and execute more than one view state without causing a full-page refresh. Web Flow now supports launching a flow in "embedded" mode. In this mode a flow can transition to other view states without a client-side redirect during Ajax requests. See Section 11.7, “Embedding A Flow On A Page” and Section 13.8, “Embedding a Flow On a Page”.
